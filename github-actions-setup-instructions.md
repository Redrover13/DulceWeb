# Modern GitHub Actions Setup Instructions

Follow these precise steps to set up a working GitHub Actions workflow for your pnpm monorepo:

## Step 1: Create the Workflow File in GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Click "New workflow"
4. Select "set up a workflow yourself"

## Step 2: Copy the Modern Workflow Configuration

Copy the exact contents of the `modern-github-actions-workflow.yml` file I've created for you.

This workflow:

- Uses the latest GitHub Actions runners (ubuntu-latest)
- Uses the official pnpm action (pnpm/action-setup@v3)
- Sets up Node.js 20 with proper pnpm caching
- Runs all your build steps in sequence
- Uploads build artifacts

## Step 3: Commit the Workflow

1. Name the file `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
2. Click "Start commit"
3. Add a commit message like "Add CI/CD workflow"
4. Click "Commit new file"

## Step 4: Monitor the Workflow Run

The workflow will automatically run after you commit it. You can monitor its progress in the Actions tab.

## Important Notes

- This workflow uses the official pnpm action which is the recommended approach
- It properly sets up caching to speed up subsequent runs
- It uses Node.js 20, which is the latest LTS version
- No compatibility hacks or workarounds are needed with this modern setup

If you encounter any issues, check the GitHub Actions logs for specific error messages.
